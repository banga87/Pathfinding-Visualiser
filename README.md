# Pathfinding-Visualiser
This project is a pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript build.
The user can choose a start location, end location and select a pathfinding algorithm to find a path from start to finish on a grid.
The grid is built using a loop the creates a DIV and stores information within each cell DIV. The algorithm checks each DIV as it iterates over them and makes decisions based on the contents.

The algorithms used are:
- Depth-First Search
- Breadth-First Search
- Dijkstra's
- A*
  
The users can also add walls that are impassable by the algorithm as well as weights that are used to help Dijkstra's and A* make decisions.
